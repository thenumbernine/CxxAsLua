This is my attempt to implement the functionality of Lua into C++ as closely as possible.

I've seen some other similar projects doing the same thing with JavaScript or other scripting languages out there.

It's purely for humor/academic reasons, though if you really wanted, you could tweak it a bit and make a Lua->C++ translator... which would probably still be slower than LuaJIT... or even pure Lua for that matter.
